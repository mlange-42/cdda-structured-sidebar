## Installation

**Option 1: Download**

**Option 2: Git clone**

**Enable the mod**

## Configuration

After installation, press `}` in-game to configure the sidebar.

> It is recommended to move the `Log` widget right above `Compass/Overmap`.

## Known issues

The mod replaces the "bodygraph"" widget in all other sidebars by a smaller version. This is caused by a hard-coded source for the widget in CDDA.
